## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run AlphaSuite on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   PostgreSQL Server
*   Git

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlphaSuite.git
    cd AlphaSuite
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # macOS / Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   **TA-Lib**: This library has a C dependency that must be installed first. Follow the official [TA-Lib installation instructions](https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib) for your operating system.
    *   Install the remaining Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

4.  **Set up the Database:**
    *   Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.
    *   Create a new database (e.g., `alphasuite`).
    *   The application will create the necessary tables on its first run.

5.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   Open the `.env` file and edit the variables:
        *   `DATABASE_URL`: Set this to your PostgreSQL connection string.
        *   `LLM_PROVIDER`: Set to `gemini` or `ollama` to choose your provider.
        *   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required if `LLM_PROVIDER` is `gemini`.
        *   `OLLAMA_URL`: The URL for your running Ollama instance (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`). Required for `ollama`.
        *   `OLLAMA_MODEL`: The name of the model you have pulled in Ollama (e.g., `llama3`).

### 3. Usage

1.  **Initial Data Download:**
    Before running the app, you need to populate the database with market data. Run the download script from your terminal. This may take a long time for the initial run.
    ```bash
    # Download data for the US market (recommended for first run)
    python download_data.py pipeline
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit Web Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run Home.py
    ```
    Open your web browser to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Follow the In-App Workflow:**
    1.  **Populate Data:** Go to the **Data Management** page and run the "Daily Pipeline" or a "Full Download".
    2.  **Scan for Signals:** Use the **Market Scanner** to find live trading signals.
    3.  **Tune & Train:** To build custom models, navigate to the **Model Training & Tuning** page.
    4.  **Analyze & Backtest:** Use the **Portfolio Analysis** page to validate your strategies.
    5.  **Deep Research:** Use the **Stock Report** page for in-depth analysis of specific stocks.
